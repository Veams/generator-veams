# <%= projectName %>

The project is build with `veams-cli`. You can add or modify settings in the provided `veams-cli.json`.

`Veams-cli` is responsible for the initial setup as well as for the scaffolding process of blueprints.
Every task and configuration files are exposed in the `configs` folder.

For more information take a look at the Veams documentation.

## Folder Structure

------------------

### Basic Files and Folders

The app contains multiple sections which have its own responsibility. In general the structure looks like that:

``` bash
├── app.js
├── app.events.js
├── app.veams.js
├── app.scss
├── assets
│   ├── fonts
│   ├── icons
│   ├── img
│   └── media
├── core
│   ├── components
│   ├── layouts
│   ├── store
│   └── styles
│       ├── base.scss
│       ├── get-media.scss
│       ├── modifiers.scss
│       └── print.scss
├── features(*)
├── pages
└── shared
    ├── components
    ├── styles
        ├── _shared.scss
        ├── _vars.scss
        ├── helpers
        │   ├── _helpers.scss
        │   └── functions
        └── icons
└── utilities
```

### App Files

``` bash
├── app.js
├── app.veams.js
├── app.events.js
└── app.scss
```

These files are the main entry point of our application.

#### app.routes.js

The routes are configured by using `react-router-config`. It contains a collection of routes which are located in `pages` and/or in `features`.

### Assets

As the folder says, it contains all the assets like images, fonts, svg icons and more which we can use project wide.

### Core

``` bash
├── core
    ├── components
    ├── containers (*)
    ├── layouts
    ├── store (*)
    └── styles
        ├── base.scss
        ├── get-media.scss
        ├── modifiers.scss
        └── print.scss
```

The core is responsible for the project specific setup. It contains components and states which define the base of the application.

Core Components are global components which are app specific, means you cannot share these components project wide.

__Examples__

- Header
- Navigation
- Footer

#### Layouts

The layout contains the general structure of the application. It is responsible for the general rendering of the application.

#### Store

The core store sets up general "tables" which can be used project wide. These could be:

- ui
- config
- i18n

#### Styles

The styles folder contains all important global styles like:

- reset
- base
- modifiers

## Tasks
<% if(icons.length) { %>
------------------

### Icons (`configs/tasks/icons/`)

Icons have to be saved in your assets folder. The default location for your icons is `assets/icons`.
<% } %><% if(icons.indexOf('webfont') !== -1) { %>
#### Icons Webfont (`configs/tasks/icons/webfont.js`)

To build the webfont from your icons you only need to execute:

``` bash
npm run wefont:generate
```

This creates a new `webfont.scss` in your `shared/styles/icons` folder. The new file gets imported automatically.
Next to that it creates the font called `iconfont` in `assets/fonts`.
<% } %><% if(icons.indexOf('sprite') !== -1) { %>
#### Icons Sprite (`configs/tasks/icons/sprite.js`)

To build a sprite from your icons which will be used as background image in your CSS you only need to execute:

``` bash
npm run sprite:generate
```

This creates a new `sprite.scss` in your `shared/styles/icons` folder. The new file gets imported automatically.
Next to that it creates the sprite files called `sprite.svg` in `assets/img/`.
<% } %><% if(icons.indexOf('grunticon') !== -1) { %>
#### Icons Grunticon (`configs/tasks/icons/grunticon.js`)

Grunticon takes a folder of SVG files and outputs them to (S)CSS in 2 custom formats. For that you only need to execute:

``` bash
npm run grunticon:generate
```

This creates two files (`icons-data-png.scss`, `icons-data-svg.scss`) in your `shared/styles/icons` folder. The new file gets imported automatically.
Next to that it creates PNG fallbacks in `assets/icons/png-fallbacks/`.
<% } %><% if(images.length) { %>
------------------

### Images (`configs/tasks/images/`)

Images have to be saved in your assets folder. The default location for your icons is `assets/img`.
<% } %><% if(images.indexOf('imgResponsive') !== -1) { %>
#### Image Generation (`configs/tasks/images/images-resizer.js`)

To generate images you can use the following commands which are defined in `package.json`:

``` bash
`npm run images:generate ${files}`
```

__Examples__

1. `npm run images:generate "**/*.jpg"` => Simple globbing support.
1. `npm run images:generate "test/*.jpg"` => Globbing in a specific folder.
1. `npm run images:generate "test.jpg"` => Generate only one image.
1. `npm run images:generate "test.jpg" preset=default` => Generate one image with another preset.

**Customization**

__Paths__

All commands have a reference to the images in your `assets/img/` folder. The `assets` folder can be change in `veams-cli.json`.

__Presets__

Custom presets can easily be added by you. Take a look at the `preset` folder in the configuration path.

__Options__

You can change the `suffix` definition in the provided `config.js` file.
Furthermore you can easily add options for your presets, just take a look at https://github.com/felixrieseberg/responsive-images-generator#configuration.
<% } %><% if(images.indexOf('imgSizeExport') !== -1) { %>

#### Image Data Export (`configs/tasks/images/images-export.js`)

To export further images information to a JSON file you can use the following commands which are defined in `package.json`:

1. `npm run images:export` => Export meta data information to `images.json` in `assets` folder.
<% } %>
------------------

### Server

The provided express server instance exposes an API which you can use to work with your file system.

The API Server is a mock server which can be used in a really simple way.

Just add your JSON mocks to `src/server/mocks/${endpoint}` and
make sure that you already have an endpoint available in `src/server/api/${endpoint}`.

After that you can reach that endpoint at the following location:

- `/api/${endpoint}` => You will get all mocks in an array.
- `/api/${endpoint}/${filename}` => You will get a specific mock by using the filename as Id.

#### Add endpoint to API ([`veams-bp-mock-api-endpoint`](https://github.com/Veams/veams-bp-mock-api-endpoint))

You can easily add a new endpoint by using `veams-cli`.

Just execute the following command `veams add api [name]`.

This will create a new folder in `server/routes/`.
The only thing you have to do is referencing the file in `server/routes/index.js` by adding the snippets from `USAGE.md`.
<% if(server.indexOf('serverFakeData') !== -1) { %>

#### Fake Data Generation (`configs/tasks/faker/faker.js`)

You can generate fake data files by using the provided task.
Therefore you need to create a preset file and save it in the presets folder of the task.

The output is saved in the `mocks` folder of your server.
You can configure the destination path in `veams-cli.json`.

To generate fake data execute the following commands:

``` bash
npm run faker ${presetName} ${length}
```

__Examples__

1. `npm run faker example` => Generate 10 fake data files by using example preset.
1. `npm run faker example 100` => Generate 100 fake data files by using example preset.

__Presets__

Custom presets are easy to create.
Just take a look add the preset files in the task folder and use the [API from `faker.js`](http://marak.github.io/faker.js/faker.html).
